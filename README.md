## Project Overview
The purpose of the analysis is to determine be able to filter the data for the date, city, state, country, and shape based on user input. 
As the user input the entry, the table will only show the data searched.  


## Resuslts
The original page of the web app will show all the data. Since the data is lengthy, a filtered option was added to search for the 
data the user is interested in. The user can search the desired data by searching one or more of the following fields: date,
city, state, contry or shape. As the user input more fields the data will narrow down to only the input searched. The more 
specificic a user is, the narrower the table will get. Users have to make sure they use the proper format to input in the field 
as show in the field bar as follow then press enter to get the desired results:
 -To search by dates, the input as to be similiar to 1/10/201
 -To search by cities, the input needs to be the full city name such as Benton
 -Only the state's abbreviation is required for state search such as ca for California
 -Country search is only the US and us is used
 -Shape search requires the shape input such as circle. 

  
## Summary
The max, min and average temperature of June are respectively 85, 64, and 74 while December's are respectively 83, 56, and 71. 
Considering how low the standard deviation is for both months (3.25 for June and 3.74 for December), most of the data for both 
months are closer the average temperatures; which mean that most days the temperature are closer to 74 in June and 71 in December
which mean the these two month surfers will definitely be visiting the surf shop. Gathering data for precipitation in June and 
December would help W. Avy determine how many slow days are expected during these two months. ANother wuery that could be useful 
is to gather temperature and precipitation data by seasons which would give the expectation year round.
